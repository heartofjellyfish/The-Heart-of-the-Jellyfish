# qi.land web — context for Claude

The site for Qi · 琦's debut album *The Heart of the Jellyfish* (release: 2026-12-20).
A single scroll-driven 3D descent: above water → past the jellyfish → into the abyss.

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** App Router + TypeScript, **React 19**
- **react-three-fiber** + **drei** + **three.js** (`three/examples/jsm/objects/Water.js` for the water surface, drei `<Sky>` for atmosphere)
- **leva** for in-browser tweaking (toggled with `?tweak=1`)
- **Tailwind** for the typographic overlay
- Deployed on Vercel

## Architecture in one paragraph

[components/Descent.tsx](components/Descent.tsx) owns a single `depthRef` (0..1) driven by scroll. It mounts [components/OceanScene.tsx](components/OceanScene.tsx) (the R3F `<Canvas>` + scene) and [components/Poem.tsx](components/Poem.tsx) (the scrollable text overlay). Every visual element inside the scene reads `depthRef.current` from `useFrame` to drive its own appearance — fog color, camera Y, light shaft visibility, particle opacity, etc. There is **no global state library**; the ref is the single source of truth.

### Depth landmarks

| depth | landmark | camera Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | above water (sunset sky) | +14 |
| 0.05–0.18 | crossing the surface | — |
| 0.55 | jellyfish (the heart, frame VI) | -22 |
| 0.78 | shipwreck reveal threshold | — |
| 1.00 | abyss | -55 |

Constants live at the top of OceanScene: `SURFACE_Y`, `JELLY_Y`, `ABYSS_Y`, `WRECK_Y`, `WRECK_REVEAL_DEPTH`. Don't hardcode magic Y values in new props — derive them.

### Focus shortcuts

- `/` — full descent
- `/?focus=heart` — locks at d=0.55
- `/?focus=abyss` — locks at d=0.92
- `?tweak=1` — shows leva panel

## Adding a 3D prop (recipe for new sessions)

This is the path the user will repeatedly walk. **Follow it.**

1. **Place the GLB.** Put assets at `public/models/<name>/model.glb`. Existing examples: `chrysaora/`, `wreck/`. Photogrammetry models (like the wreck) often bake bright lighting into the albedo — expect to multiply `mat.color` by 0.4–0.6 and bump `mat.roughness` in a `scene.traverse` after `useGLTF`.

2. **Decide the depth window.** Each prop has a reveal range on `depthRef`. Pick where it should appear in the descent (use the table above). Pass `depthRef` into the component and read it in `useFrame`.

3. **Gate large assets.** Anything > ~5MB should NOT use `useGLTF.preload` at module top. Instead, write a `<XxxGate>` wrapper that flips a `useState` only once `depthRef` crosses the reveal threshold — see `WreckGate` in OceanScene. This keeps first paint fast.

4. **Mount inside `SunsetScene`.** Add the component alongside `<ChrysaoraHero />` / `<WreckGate />` near the bottom of `SunsetScene`. Wrap GLB-loading components in `<Suspense fallback={null}>`.

5. **Match the fog/atmosphere.** Set `mat.fog = true` on every material so the prop dissolves into the depth palette. Underwater props should have `transparent: false` unless they really need alpha — fog handles the falloff.

6. **Credit the source.** If the asset has any attribution requirement, add a line to [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md). Don't ship without it for CC-BY assets — it's legally required.

7. **Verify in the browser, don't just claim it works.** A preview server typically runs during sessions. Use it. For something at depth d=X, navigate to `/?focus=heart` or scroll programmatically, screenshot, and confirm the prop actually renders (camera framing, fog, lighting all read right).

## Asset budget

- First paint: keep `<5MB` of model data preloaded (currently: chrysaora ~1.6MB).
- Gated assets: target `<50MB` each; texture-resize before going higher.
- Texture rule of thumb: 1k for distant/abyss props, 4k for hero/close props, never 8k on the web.

## Don't

- Don't introduce a state library — the `depthRef` pattern is intentional and stays.
- Don't `useGLTF.preload` heavy assets at module scope (breaks first-paint budget).
- Don't add a prop without picking its depth window — "always visible" props clutter the descent.
- Don't ship without verifying in the browser preview.
- Don't pair `<Bloom>` with any `MeshPhysicalMaterial` that has `transmission > 0` (the jelly bell). The transmission backdrop produces NaN/Inf at animated mesh edges, and **no `luminanceThreshold` filters them out** — NaN comparisons always fail. The visible symptom is flashing black squares over the hero. If glow is wanted later, use the `<Selection>` + `<Select>` + `selectionLayer` pattern so only specific non-transmissive meshes feed the bloom input.
- Don't set `transparent: true` on a material that already uses `transmission`. Transmission handles its own alpha through a separate pass; doubling up with `transparent + DoubleSide` causes depth-sort flicker on animated skinned meshes.
